# Quickstart: Azure Cosmos DB for Table - Azure SDK for Go

This is a simple web application to illustrate common basic usage of Azure Cosmos DB for Table with the Azure SDK for Go.

## Prerequisites

## Quickstart

1. Log in to Azure Developer CLI. *This is only required once per-install.*

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Initialize this template (`cosmos-db-table-go-quickstart`) using `azd init`

    ```bash
    azd init --template cosmos-db-table-go-quickstart
    ```

1. Ensure that **Docker** is running in your environment.

1. Use `azd up` to provision your Azure infrastructure and deploy the web application to Azure.

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```
